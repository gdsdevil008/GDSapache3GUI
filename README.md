# Package Your Application

Once youâ€™ve set up all your files, follow these instructions to package your app manually.
On Windows:

    Open Command Prompt or Git Bash.

    Navigate to your project directory.

    Run the build_windows.bat batch script to create the .exe:

    build_windows.bat

        This will create a .exe file inside the dist/ folder.

On macOS:

    Open Terminal.

    Navigate to your project directory.

    Make the build_macos.sh script executable:

chmod +x build_macos.sh

Run the build_macos.sh script:

    ./build_macos.sh

        This will create the .app file and then use create-dmg to package it into a .dmg file inside the dist/ folder.
